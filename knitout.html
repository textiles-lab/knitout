<h1>The "Knitout" (.k) File Format v0.6</h1>
<p>
Knitout (.k) is a file format that can represent low-level knitting machine instructions in a machine-independent way.
The format is easy to read and write from code, and reasonably human-readable.
It is hoped that knitout can serve as an output file format for design tools, and an input file format for knitting machines and simulators.
</p>
<p>Knitout has no relation to the custom sock vendor of the same name.</p>
<p>
The remainder of this document describes the format itself, the design principles behind the format, and ends with some comments about particular decisions.
</p>

</p>

<h2>File Format</h2>
<p>
Knitout is a straightforward list of knitting instructions to execute to create a knit object, along with a header describing specific information about the machine it is designed to run on.
</p>
<h3>Filenames, Encoding, Line Endings</h3>
<p>
Knitout files are named with the <code>.k</code> extension.
</p>
<p>
Knitout files contain UTF8-encoded text.
</p>
<p>
Knitout is line-oriented, and knitout files use the LF character to terminate lines (<code>'\n'</code>, U+000A).
</p>
<p>
Programs that write knitout format files should name then with a <code>.k</code> extension,
encode them as UTF8,
use only the "space" (U+0020) and "tab" (U+0009) characters for whitespace,
and use the LF character (U+000A) as a line ending.
Programs that read knitout files should support files produced in this way, and may support other extensions, encodings, whitespace characters, and line endings (though they should warn that the file is not standard).
</p>
<h3>Magic String</h3>
<pre><code>;!knitout-2
</code></pre>
<p>
Knitout files begin with a magic string <code>;!knitout-VERSION</code> followed by a linefeed.
<code>VERSION</code> is an integer indicating the current version.
The version number will be incremented when features are moved from extensions into the main language.
</p>
<p>
Programs that write knitout should always use the latest version of which they are aware.
Programs that read knitout must accept any version number, but should warn if the version is later than one they support.
</p>
<h3>Comment Header</h3>
<pre><code><comment>;;Machine: SWG091N2
;;Gauge: 15
;;Yarn-5: 50-50 Rust
;;Carriers: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
;;Position: Right</comment>
</code></pre>
<p>
After the magic string, knitout files contain a series of special comments (starting with <code>;;</code>) known as the "comment header."
These comments give additional information about the machine intended to execute the knitout code in the file.
</p>
<p>
Each line in the comment header begins with the string "<code>;;</code>", followed by the header name, followed by the string "<code>: </code>", followed by the header value.
</p>

<h4>Required Headers</h4>

<p>
The following headers are required because their values influence the topology of the finished knit item:
</p>

<table>
<tr>
<th>Name</th><th>Value</th>
<th>Meaning</th>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Carriers</td><td>C1 C2,C3;C4 C5 ...</td>
<td>Carrier layout.
A space-separated list of rail definitions (front-to-back).
For machines with one carrier per rail, each rail definition is a single carrier name.
For machines that support multiple carriers on a rail, each rail definition is a comma-separated list of names in left-to-right order with a semicolon dividing the left-side and right-side carriers (e.g., <code>L1,L2,L3;R1,R2</code>).
Knitout backends may be more strict in carrier header requirements (including requiring an exact string for the carriers header).
</td>
</tr>

</table>

<p>
Tools that write knitout <em>must</em> include a <code>Carriers</code> header;
tools that read knitout must warn if a <code>Carriers</code> header is missing, though they may also continue to process the file.
</p>


<h4>Other Headers</h4>

<p>
The following headers are optional:
</p>

<table>
<tr>
<th>Name</th><th>Value</th>
<th>Meaning</th>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Machine</td><td>M</td>
<td>the model name M of the target machine</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Gauge</td><td>G</td>
<td>the gauge G (in needles/inch) of the target machine</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Yarn-C</td><td>type color</td>
<td>yarn to load in carrier C</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Position</td><td>P</td>
<td>where to place the operations on the needle bed; Left, Center, Right, and Keep are standard values</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>X-*</td><td>*</td>
<td>extension header</td>
</tr>

</table>

<h3>Operations</h3>
<pre><code><op>knit</op> <par>+ f14 A B</par> <comment>;knit together</comment>
<op>knit</op> <par>+ f15 A B</par>
<op>knit</op> <par>+ f16 A B</par>
<comment>;note to self: maybe put in a tuck here?</comment>
<op>knit</op> <par>+ f17 A</par>
<op>knit</op> <par>+ f18 A</par>
<op>knit</op> <par>+ f19 A</par>
</code></pre>
<p>
After the comment header, all lines in the file contain an (optional) operation followed by an (optional) comment.
The operation is everything up to the first ';' character, the comment is everything after:
</p>
<pre><code><op>knit</op> <par>+ f14 A B</par> <comment>;knit together</comment>
<clarification>^--operation--^ ^--comment--^</clarification>

<op>knit</op> <par>+ f14 A B</par>
<clarification>^--operation-^ (no comment)</clarification>

<comment>;note to self</comment>
 <clarification>^-comment--^ (no operation)</clarification>
</code></pre>
<p>
The operation is a whitespace-separated list of tokens.
Leading and trailing whitespace may appear and is ignored.
The first token is the opcode, and the remaining tokens [if any] are the parameters.

<h3>Extensions</h3>
<p>Support for extending knitout is supplied through the extension headers namespace (<code>X-*</code>) and the extension opcode namespace (<code>x-*</code>).
Programs that read knitout files should warn upon encountering an extension header or opcode they do not support; but should otherwise ignore the header or opcode.
</p>

<h3>Source Comments</h3>
<p>To aid in debugging, a special type of comment is provided that identifies the source code location corresponding to the current line in the knitout file.
These "source comments" always begin with the string "<code>!source: </code>". Anything after this is considered the source location.
</p>
<p>Tools that parse knitout files should make no assumptions about the format of source locations, and should print source information intact when reporting errors.
</p>
<pre><code><op>knit</op> <par>+ f1 A</par> <comment>;!source: knit.js:53</comment>
<op>knit</op> <par>+ f2 A</par> <comment>;!source: helper.cpp -- do_knit().2</comment></code></pre>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Knitout operations are straightfoward to interpret when generating machine control code.
However, knitout files don't provide any direct guidance on two important issues: carriage passes and kickbacks.
</p>
<h3>Carriage Passes</h3>
<p>In general, backends should attempt to produce machine instructions that fabricate a given knitout file in as few passes as possible, with the constraint that the result must be "as if" the stitches and rackings were performed one-at-a-time in the order written.
</p>
<p>
When writing knitout files, one should generally be assume that a backend will at least unify stitches into carriage passes, instead of performing each stitch in its own pass.
Backends may go further, unifying stitches with different carriers on different parts of the bed into single passes, or using multiple knitting systems to perform multiple stitches on the same needle in a single pass.
</p>
<h3>Kickbacks</h3>
<p>When interpreting knitout files, implementations should maintain a <em>logical position</em> for each yarn carrier that is currently in action.
The logical position of a carrier is set and updated by needle operations involving the carrier or the needle to which its logical position is associated.
</p>
<p>
In practice -- owing to things like yarn carrier stopping distances -- the <em>physical</em> position of a yarn carrier is often different from its logical position.
A knitout interpreter must add yarn carrier motions (called "kickbacks" in manual knit programming) to ensure that any differences between the physical and logical positions of yarn carriers are not observable in the finished knit.
We call these "implicit kickbacks" and -- among other things -- they make knitout much easier to write colorwork with.
</p>
<p>
Carrier logical positions are infinitesimally left or right of a needle, which -- for the purposes of this discussion -- we will write by appending a <code>+</code> or <code>-</code> to a needle or slider name.
So, for instance, the position just to the right of needle <code>f3</code> will be written <code>f3+</code>.
This is the same position as <code>fs3+</code>, but keeping them distinguished is sensible because of the way loop tracking works.
</p>
<h4>Update rules</h4>
<ol>
<li><b>Set:</b> After <code>tuck D N CS</code>, <code>knit D N CS</code>, <code>split D N N2 CS</code>, or <code>miss D N CS</code>, the logical position of each carrier in <code>CS</code> is set to <code>ND</code>.
</li>
<li><b>Motion:</b> After <code>split D N N2 CS</code> or <code>xfer N N2</code>, the logical position of any carrier <em>not in <code>CS</code></em> that has logical position <code>N+</code> is updated to have position <code>N2+</code>, and similarly for <code>N-</code> and <code>N2-</code>.
</li>
</ol>
<h4>Examples</h4>
<p>The "set" rule:</p>
<pre><code><op>knit</op> <par>+ f-3 A</par>    <comment>;A has logical position f-3+</comment>
<op>tuck</op> <par>- b2 C D</par>   <comment>;C and D have logical position b2-</comment>
<op>split</op> <par>+ f3 b3 B</par> <comment>;B has logical position f3+</comment>
<op>miss</op> <par>- bs10 E</par>   <comment>;E has logical position bs10-</comment>
</code></pre>

<p>The "motion" rule:</p>
<pre><code><op>knit</op> <par>+ f3 X</par>      <comment>;X has logical position f3+</comment>
<op>xfer</op> <par>f3 b3</par>       <comment>;X has logical position b3+</comment>
<op>split</op> <par>- b3 fs3 Y</par> <comment>;X has logical position fs3+, Y has logical position b3-</comment>
<op>rack</op> <par>-1</par>          <comment>;logical positions unchanged</comment>
<op>xfer</op> <par>fs3 b4</par>      <comment>;X has logical position b4+</comment>
</code></pre>

<p>Basic example:</p>
<pre><code><op>knit</op> <par>+ f1 A</par> <comment>;A has logical position f1+, physical position is likely further right</comment>
<op>xfer</op> <par>f2 b2</par>  <comment>;A should be kicked left; yarn from f1+ to A's physical position would interfere</comment>
 
<op>knit</op> <par>+ f10 B</par> <comment>;B has logical position f10+, physical position is likely further right</comment>
<op>knit</op> <par>+ f9  C</par> <comment>;no kickback needed</comment>
<op>knit</op> <par>+ f11 C</par> <comment>;kickback needed: yarn from f10+ to B's physical position would interfere</comment>
</code></pre>
<p>
Using the <code>miss</code> operation to override implicit kickback behavior:
</p>
<pre><code><op>knit</op> <par>+ f1 A</par> <comment>;A has logical position f1+</comment>
<op>miss</op> <par>+ f2 A</par> <comment>;A's logical position set to f2+</comment>
<op>xfer</op> <par>f2 b2</par>  <comment>;A should be kicked right (or not at all)</comment>
</code></pre>

<p>
Direction matters:
</p>
<pre><code><op>knit</op> <par>+ f1 A</par> <comment>;A has logical position f1+, physical position is likely further right</comment>
<op>miss</op> <par>- f1 A</par> <comment>;A has logical position f1-, physical position is likely further left</comment>
<op>xfer</op> <par>f2 b2 </par> <comment>;no kickback needed: yarn from f1- to A's physical position is not in the way</comment>
</code></pre>

<h2>Design Notes</h2>
<p>
This section provides notes on the thinking behind the design choices that went into knitout.
</p>
<h3>Design Principles</h3>
<p>
<b>Low-level.</b>
The format is low-level. It contains no flow-control, abstractions, or grouping primitives.
</p>
<p>
<b>Output-oriented.</b>
Knitout contains exactly the instructions required to fabricate a knit object.
</p>
<p><b>Debug-able.</b>
As an output language, it is important that instructions in a knitout file can be tied back to their source in design programs.
Thus, if there is a problem in fabrication or simulation, an error can be reported with a reasonable source location.
</p>
<p><b>Easy to use.</b>
It should be simple to write software that reads or writes knitout files.
</p>
<h3>Challenges and Resolutions</h3>
<p><b>C:</b> Should we use implicit or explicit kickbacks?</p>
<p><b>R:</b> Implicit.
Explicit kickbacks make it easier to write a backend, but harder to write design tools, write knitout files by hand, or to interpret what knitout files are producing.
We expect that more frontend tools will be written than backend tools, and prefer the clarity that comes from not having to constantly think about yarn capture when producing a knitout file.
The <code>miss</code> opcode allows frontend authors who wish to schedule their own kickbacks to do so.
</p>
<p>
It may make sense to introduce an extension header ";;X-Kickbacks: Explicit" to control this behavior.
</p>

<p><b>C:</b> Should the format support 'drop', 'amiss', and 'xfer'?</p>
<p><b>R:</b> Yes.
These are synonyms for 'knit', 'tuck', and 'split' with no yarns; which makes them redundant.
On the other hand, they are expected and would certainly be provided by any interface; also, having these in the language avoids the weirdness of needing to specify a left/right direction for a transfer.
</p>

<p><b>C:</b> How to support the wide variety of takedown systems and features? (E.g. fabric presser, rollers, combs, segmented combs.)</p>
<p><b>R:</b>
For now, we leave this for extensions; if common themes begin to emerge, we will make the features core operations.
We are likely to support an "x-presser on/auto/off" operation for the SWG backend.
</p>

<p><b>C:</b> One generally can't bring a yarn into action without actually making a stitch with it. Should we combine 'in[hook]' and knitting instructions? Should we require that it be followed by a knitting instruction?</p>
<p><b>R:</b>
We considered, but rejected, several resolutions:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
Make 'in[hook]' a prefix to a knitting instruction (e.g. 'inhook knit + f2 A C').
This seems to increase file parsing complexity.
</li>
<li>
Require that 'in[hook]' always be immediately followed by a knitting instruction for the named yarns.
This seems to increase file writing complexity, and perhaps file parsing complexity.
</li>
<li>
Remove 'in[hook]', and have implicit yarn ins.
This seems to make it easier to make errors in writing knitout files.
</li>
</ol>
<p>
Each of these possible resolutions seems to make it harder to read, write, or understand knitout files.
Instead, we changed the language of the specification to make it clear that 'in[hook]' <em>marks</em> carriers to be inserted when next they are used, instead of inserting them directly.
</p>
<p>
In addition, we suggest that programs that read knitout files should produce a warning if carriers are marked for inserting but not used for a long time.
</p>

<p><b>C:</b> Should the back bed move left or right relative to the front bed for positive racking values?</p>
<p><b>R:</b> Positive racking values move the back bed right.
Here are two justifications, both of which are relatively weak:
</p>
<ul>
<li>One way to indicate the racking would be to attach a pointer to the back bed and a scale to the front bed. (One wouldn't put the scale on the back bed because it is hard to see.)
The selected convention means that the numbers on the scale are increasing left-to-right.
</li>
<li>
When trying to align a front and back needle, "front index minus back index" seems like a natural order for subtraction.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
(However, in knitout 0.4, racking values worked the opposite way.)
</p>
